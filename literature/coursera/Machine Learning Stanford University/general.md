# Week one

## Supervised learning,
	• right answers given or aka regression, predict continuous valued output
	• classification problem ,discrete valued output (0 or 1)
	• support vector machine
## Unsupervised learning
	• here is a data set can u find structure in the data without labels
	• clustering algorithms
	• social network analysis
	• market segmentaion
	• organise computing clusters
	• astronomcal data analysis
	• cocktail party algorithm
	• octave programming environment or matlab
	• Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.
	• We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.
	• With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.
	• Example:
	• Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.
	• Non-clustering: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).


Model representation.
- m = number of examples
- x = input, variable/features
- y = output variable/ target variable
- i = ith training example(an example)
- h = function or hypothesis
- univeriate linear regression, one variable
- Cost function
- squared error function commonly used for regression problems
